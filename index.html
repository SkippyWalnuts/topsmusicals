<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
  Since 1927 we’ve put on over a hundred full productions, not to mention the many 
  concerts and cabarets we perform in venues ranging from pubs and fêtes to the Royal 
  Albert Hall and Twickenham Stadium. We've also been seen in films and television programmes,  
  we've sung before royalty on the pitch at major England international rugby matches, and 
  we've appeared in national touring productions of shows like Evita and Whistle Down the Wind 
  for Bill Kenwright. We're also extremely proud of a significant number of our past members who 
  have gone on to enjoy successful professional theatre careers and currently can be seen in 
  national theatre tours, on cruise ships, on the West End stage and even on Broadway!
  <br />
  <br />
We won the very first Swan Award for Best Musical Production when the Swans started in 1986 
and since the year 2000 we have won the Swan Award for Best Musical no fewer than seven times, 
with six winners for Best Actress in a Musical, five Best Actor in a Musical, seven Best Supporting
 Actor/Actress in a Musical and one Best Young Performer. Gill Wade, Peter Holoway and Babette Langford 
 have all won the Swan Accolade Award. We've also won numerous NODA awards over the years, including a 
 number of the prestigious Flame Awards.

<h6>Who runs TOpS?</h6>

      "Amateur theatre has underpinned all the theatre in this country and the chance to 
      act with others is useful even for those who do not want to make a career. When 
      you work in a little theatre it can only be done in friendship and by putting yourself 
      out. There are many wonderful actors in amateur shows who could easily make a living
      for themselves in the professional theatre..."

    <h2>Join Us</h2>
    <h3>TOpS is a great community to be a part of, either on stage or behind the scenes. If you're interested in joining, here's what you need to know</h3>
  </div>

    <div class="col-lg-4 mb-3">
      <div class="card orange-bg">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3>Auditions & Fees</h3>
          <p class="card-text">We audition everyone who wants to take part in our main productions. Audition dates are announced at the beginning of each production schedule.
            Membership is currently £20 per year for everyone, regardless of status. We also charge a production fee and sometimes a costume supplement, which varies from show to show. The fee for recent productions has been between £80 and £130 depending on how expensive the show is to produce, but we remain one of the most affordable societies in the area. The fee for cabarets and concerts is currently £40.
            If you are not appearing on stage you are not expected to pay the production fee.  If you only want to audition to see if you get a principal role then you will be asked to pay an audition fee. If you decide to join then this fee will be deducted from your membership. Only paid members or people who have paid the audition fee are allowed to audition.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h3>Rehearsals</h3>
          <p class="card-text">We rehearse with the full company on Tuesdays and some Sundays in the Whitton/Twickenham area – at the moment this is at Whitton Community Centre, Percy Road, Whitton, close to buses and rail. Principal rehearsals are usually held on a Thursday.
            A full rehearsal schedule is published and updated in our Members' Facebook Group, which you can join as a member of TOPS.
            If you are unable to attend a rehearsal for which you’re called you are expected to let us know with as much notice as possible in case we need to reschedule other people.
            If you regularly miss rehearsals, with or without notifying us, you might be asked to step down from the production.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="col-lg-4 mb-3">
      <div class="card orange-bg">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3>What We Ask of You</h3>
          <p class="card-text">We don’t demand that you have any pre-existing special skills on stage, but we do expect you to be enthusiastic about TOPS both on and off stage. Of course if you are already a great singer, dancer or actor then that’s an added bonus.
            Our productions are to a very high standard but we are still an amateur society and we recognise that one of our responsibilities is to help develop stage skills at all levels. 
            We are also interested in you if you prefer to be behind the scenes, whether that’s making tea at rehearsals, helping with our marketing activity or building props and scenery.
            We’re not naïve, and we realise that people have other commitments at home and at work, but we encourage as much participation in activities beyond just turning up for rehearsals and performances. That includes social and fundraising events.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  </div>
  <div class="row mt-2">
    <p>So, those are the basic facts. If you’re a Facebook user click TOPS Ad Libs to join our closed group for members and friends of TOPS. That’s the best way to get to know what we’re up to week by week. We also have separate Facebook groups for our current production(s) which are only for members who are actively involved in the current production.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We hope that’s given you enough information to make a decision about whether TOPS is right for you. If you'd just like to check us out before committing, ask about coming to watch a rehearsal. If you haven’t already, let us know a little bit about yourself – any stage experience or other talents, what singing voice type you are (if you know), as well as contact details (phone, email etc).  
      You can send this, and any other questions you may have, in a private message via Facebook or to <span class="ticket-query-contact"><a href="mailto:secretary@topsmusicals.co.uk">secretary@topsmusicals.co.uk</a></span>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Hope to see you at a rehearsal soon!
